# Network State Council **Terms of Service**

Last Updated: October 30, 2024

## Welcome to the Network State Council

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Network State Council platform and services. By using our services, you agree to these terms in their entirety. If you disagree with any part of these terms, please do not use our services.

## Our Services

The Network State Council provides a platform for validating and supporting emerging network states. We offer validation services, governance tools, and community connection infrastructure to help digital communities evolve into recognized network states. Our platform enables token-based governance, allowing community members to participate in validation decisions and platform governance.

## Token-Based Governance

Our governance system operates through tokens that grant participation rights in the Council's decision-making processes. While holding tokens allows you to participate in governance, tokens do not represent ownership of the Council itself. We maintain the right to adjust voting mechanisms to ensure fair and balanced governance.

## Validation Process

Our validation process for network states is transparent and community-driven. When you apply for validation, you commit to providing accurate and truthful information about your network state. We assess applications based on publicly available criteria, with decisions made through our community governance system.

## Your Responsibilities

Using our platform means committing to maintaining the integrity of our ecosystem. You agree to provide accurate information, maintain the security of your account, and comply with applicable laws. We expect all users to respect the rights of others and avoid any attempts to manipulate or misuse our services.

## Privacy and Your Data

We respect your privacy and protect your data. While we collect information necessary to provide our services, you retain ownership of your submitted data. We may use aggregate data to improve our services and for research, but we handle personal information according to our Privacy Policy.

## Intellectual Property

The Council maintains ownership of its branding and proprietary tools, while open-source components follow their respective licenses. You keep the rights to your original content, though you grant us permission to use submitted content as needed to provide our services.

## Service Reliability and Liability

We provide our services "as is" and make no specific warranties about reliability. You understand and accept the risks associated with using blockchain-based platforms and digital governance systems. Our liability is limited to the fees paid for services, and we're not responsible for indirect damages.

## Changes to Services

We may modify our services or these terms as needed to better serve our community. We'll notify you of significant changes, and your continued use of our services after such changes indicates your acceptance of the modified terms.

## Ending Your Participation

You may stop using our services at any time, though certain obligations may continue. We may also terminate services to users who violate these terms or revoke validation status when necessary. Token holdings remain subject to blockchain protocols regardless of service termination.

## Resolving Disputes

We aim to resolve disputes through our governance system first. If that proves insufficient, we may use arbitration or legal proceedings as needed. These terms are governed by [Jurisdiction] law, and you agree to submit to the specified jurisdiction for any legal matters.

## Questions and Contact

If you have questions about these terms or our services, please contact us at [contact information]. We're here to help you understand your rights and obligations as part of our community.

By using the Network State Council services, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to these terms.
