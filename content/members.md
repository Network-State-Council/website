# Membership

The Network State Council brings together three vital groups that form the foundation of our ecosystem: Token Holders, Validated Network States, and Council Contributors.

## Our Community

Token holders are at the heart of our governance structure. Through our transparent, blockchain-based system, they participate in crucial decisions about network state validation and the council's future. This ensures our ecosystem remains truly decentralized and community-driven.

Validated Network States represent communities that have successfully completed our rigorous validation process. These pioneering organizations receive official recognition from the Council and gain access to our suite of tools and resources. More importantly, they become part of an interconnected network of like-minded communities, sharing knowledge and building bridges between digital nations.

Our Council Contributors comprise developers, governance specialists, and thought leaders who actively shape our ecosystem. These dedicated individuals work on open-source tools, governance frameworks, and community initiatives that drive our mission forward.

## Joining the Council

Becoming part of the Network State Council is straightforward and open to all who share our vision. Token holders can begin participating in governance immediately upon acquiring tokens. Aspiring network states can initiate the validation process through our open application system, while contributors can engage directly with our existing projects and proposals.

All members share a commitment to transparency, decentralized governance, and the advancement of network states. Together, we're building more than just a council â€“ we're creating the foundation for the future of human organization.
