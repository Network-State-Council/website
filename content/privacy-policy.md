# Network State Council **Privacy Policy**

Last Updated: October 30, 2024

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

At the Network State Council, we believe in transparent and responsible handling of your information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data while providing our validation and governance services for network states.

## Information We Collect

We collect information that helps us provide and improve our services. When you interact with our platform, we receive data such as your wallet address, governance participation, and validation-related information. If you're representing a network state, we collect organizational information necessary for the validation process.

We never collect more information than necessary, and we're always transparent about what we collect and why. Your blockchain interactions are public by nature, but we handle any additional personal information with the utmost care.

## How We Use Your Information

Your information helps us validate network states and facilitate governance. We use it to process validation applications, enable voting participation, and maintain platform security. We may analyze aggregate data to improve our services and understand how the platform is being used, but we never sell your personal information to third parties.

When you participate in governance or validation processes, your wallet address and votes become part of the public blockchain record. This transparency is essential for our decentralized governance system, but we ensure that sensitive information remains protected.

## Information Sharing

We believe in minimal data sharing. We only share information when:
- You explicitly request or approve it
- It's necessary for providing our core services
- We're required to by law
- It's essential for platform security

Your validation-related information may be shared within our ecosystem to facilitate network state recognition and collaboration, but always with your knowledge and in accordance with our security standards.

## Data Security

Security is fundamental to our platform. We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. While blockchain data is public by design, we protect additional personal information through encryption and secure storage systems.

## Your Rights and Choices

You maintain control over your information. You can:
- Access your personal data
- Request corrections to your information
- Withdraw from non-essential data collection
- Request data deletion where applicable

Remember that certain information, like blockchain transactions and governance participation, becomes a permanent public record and cannot be deleted due to the nature of blockchain technology.

## International Data Handling

As a global platform for network states, we handle data from around the world. We follow applicable international data protection standards and ensure appropriate safeguards when transferring data across borders.

## Cookie Usage

We use essential cookies to maintain platform functionality. You can control non-essential cookies through your browser settings. Our cookie usage is minimal and focused on improving your platform experience rather than tracking.

## Changes to Privacy Practices

Our privacy practices may evolve as our platform grows. We'll notify you of significant changes through our platform and update this policy accordingly. Your continued use of our services after such changes indicates your acceptance of the updated practices.

## Specific Rights by Region

Different regions have specific privacy rights and protections. We honor these requirements and provide region-specific information when applicable. If you have questions about privacy rights in your region, please contact us.

## Children's Privacy

Our services are not intended for children under 13. We don't knowingly collect information from children. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under 13, we'll take steps to delete it promptly.

## Contact Us About Privacy
